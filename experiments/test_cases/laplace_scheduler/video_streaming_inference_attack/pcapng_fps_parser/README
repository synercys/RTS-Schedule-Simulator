### How to run the auto scripts:
1. Download the package
2. Copy all the `.pcapng` files whose FPS values you would like to analyze
3. `cd` into the package's directory
4. Run the following three in order:
4.1. `./1_build.sh` which builds an docker image that can run the FPS calculator program
4.2. `./2_start.sh` which will start a container
4.3. Run `./3_run.py` inside the started container
5. The textual results will be saved in the file `results.txt`

### How to run manually:
You can directly run the Python program `PcapngFPSCalculator.py` with arguments based on your needs:
```
usage: PcapngFPSCalculator.py [-h] -i INPUT [--start_id START_ID] [--end_id END_ID] [--fps_count FPS_COUNT] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --start_id START_ID   Beginning packet ID to include in the analysis
  --end_id END_ID       Ending packet ID to include in the analysis
  --fps_count FPS_COUNT
                        The number of FPS data points to be analyzed
  -d, --debug           Enable raw data messages

required arguments:
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Path to a Pcapng file
```

For example:
`python PcapngFPSCalculator.py -i lec_v1.pcapng --start_id=10 --end_id=100 --fps_count=100 -d`
